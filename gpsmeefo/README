 
Initial attempt to port GPS MeeFo to Qt5

Missing:
- proper dark theming
- proper icons (should be all in git)
- proper toolbar/toolbar handling
- fixing the flickable (not flicking atm)
- Map view (do not use a WebView, use QtLocation Map)
- Enable Kompass and show it, like in the later 1.6.1 version (not available, sadly)
